Version 0
- Add parse procedure for initializers/deinitializers
- Add scope management and object initialization code replacement
- Add native support for string, list, map, and set types

Version 1
- Add default values for instance members
- Add support for '.' and PTR_OP chaining (embarrassing oversight)
- Fix parameter type inference with numeric constants.
Currently they are distinguished only between integer and double.
This means that functions can only define int or double as numeric argument types.
- Add native file I/O support
- Finish implementing support for static members (trivial)
