# MPreprocessor
Preprocessor for object oriented superset of C with ARC.

Decided to rewrite the entire project in pure C to really appreciate the power of object oriented programming and bootstrapping.
The first version of the compiler will support a bare minimum grammar with just enough functionality to write a more complete compiler in the new language.

Ultimately, the syntax of the language will take from Swift and Python. The language will be strongly typed. It will support maps (dictionaries) natively, using swift's notation "[:]", and support python string indexing.

I want to use this language to take advantage of Python's expressiveness and numeric support, Swift's elegance and type safety, and C's performance and freedom to solve problems on www.projecteuler.com. To this end, the language will include a math library, big integer library, and a prime library similar to sympy.
