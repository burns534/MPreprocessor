# MPreprocessor
Preprocessor for object oriented superset of C with ARC.

Decided to rewrite the entire project in pure C to really appreciate the power of object oriented programming and bootstrapping.
The first version of the compiler will support a bare minimum grammar with just enough functionality to write a more complete compiler in the new language.
